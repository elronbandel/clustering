# Clustering 

We use 5 different clustering algorithms to learn meaningful clusters in 3 different datasets. The clustering algorithms we use, KMeans, GMM, Louvain, Prim and DBSCAN are all unsupervised learning algorithms that utilize different approaches to find meaningful clusters in the data. In this work we apply every one of them on each of the datasets, search for optimal hyper parameters and discuss the different results.
